## Prerequisites
To run these examples the following must be configured on the local host:
  * [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  * [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html)

All solutions were implemented on OS X Sierra and due to  time constraints have not been tested on any other platforms.
The benefit of using virtualisation technologies here means it should work on other platforms with no changes, however YMMV.

## Solution
